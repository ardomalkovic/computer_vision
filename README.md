# Introduction to Computer Vision by Georgia Institute of Technology Offered at Udacity [ud810]

A repository created as help during the course [Introduction to Computer Vision](https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810)

## About Course

This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image formation,
camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching, multiview geometry including stereo, motion
estimation and tracking, and classification. Weâ€™ll develop basic methods for applications that include
finding known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization,
automated alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action recognition. We focus less on the machine 
learning aspect of CV as that is really classification theory best learned in an ML course.
